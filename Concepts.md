# Windows Kernel Memory and Security Components: An Expert Analysis of VTL0 and VTL1 Paradigms

## I. Foundational Concepts: The Memory Manager's Domain

### A. General Operating System Memory Management

The memory management subsystem is a **core function** of any modern operating system, responsible for the allocation and access control of primary memory resources. Its primary objectives include optimizing memory utilization, isolating process memory spaces, facilitating dynamic memory allocation, and ensuring efficient memory access. This is achieved through **virtual memory**, which provides each process with a large, contiguous, and isolated address space. The hardware component that translates these virtual addresses into physical addresses is the **Memory Management Unit (MMU)**, which operates on multi-level page tables mapping virtual pages to physical frames.

---

The segregation of memory into a **privileged kernel space** and a **less privileged user space** is a fundamental design principle of modern kernels. This partition prevents user-mode applications from accessing or corrupting critical kernel data, enhancing system stability and security. The Windows memory architecture extends these core principles with a complex set of interconnected data structures to achieve high performance and security.

### B. The Physical Memory Backbone: `_MMPFN`

The `_MMPFN` (Memory Manager Page Frame Number) is a foundational structure in the Windows Memory Manager. Its purpose is to function as a system-wide database that tracks the state of every physical page of memory in the system, maintaining a **one-to-one mapping with each physical page of RAM**. This array, known as the PFN database, is a significant consumer of non-paged kernel memory, typically using over 1% of total physical memory. The PFN database is stored within the **VTL0 kernel's address space**. In modern versions of Windows, the base address of this array is subject to Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), and its location is dynamically determined at load time through the Dynamic Value Relocation Table.

---

The `_MMPFN` structure is complex and has evolved to be compact due to its direct impact on memory consumption. Its internal layout varies between Windows versions, but it consists of several unions that allow the structure to represent different page states.

```c
// _MMPFN structure (x64, Windows 11)  
// Note: This is a representation based on public symbols from the Vergilius Project.
typedef struct _MMPFN {
  union {
    LIST_ENTRY ListEntry; // Links the page to a variety of lists (e.g., active, modified, etc.).
    RTL_BALANCED_NODE TreeNode; // Used for a balanced tree structure in memory management.
    struct {
      union {
        SINGLE_LIST_ENTRY NextSlistPfn;
        VOID* Next;
        ULONGLONG Flink:40; // The forward link in the page list.
        ULONGLONG NodeFlinkLow:24; // Low-order bits of the forward link for tree nodes.
        MI_ACTIVE_PFN Active;
      } u1;
      union {
        ULONGLONG PteAddress:52; // Back-pointer to the Page Table Entry (PTE) mapping this physical page.  
        ULONGLONG PteFrameNumber:52;
        ULONGLONG Tdt:52; // Used for transition pages.
        ULONG PteAddressLow:28; // Low-order bits of the PTE address.
      } u2;
    } u;
  };
  union {
    MMPTE OriginalPte; // Stores the page's state when not in physical memory (e.g., paged out to disk).
    LONG AweReferenceCount;
    VOID* PteAddress; // A direct back-pointer to the PTE.  
  } u3;
  union {
    ULONGLONG LockCharged:1; // Bitfield indicating the page is locked and has a charge.
    //... other bitfields for page state flags
  } u4;
  //... other members
} MMPFN, *PMMPFN;
```
A key field is `PteAddress`, which provides a back-pointer to the PTE that maps the physical page, establishing a bidirectional link between virtual and physical memory management structures.

`OriginalPte` is used to store the page's state when it is not in physical memory, enabling the memory manager to restore the page's state during a page fault. The `_MMPFN` also contains a reference count to track how many page table entries point to the physical page, which is essential for managing shared memory and copy-on-write (CoW) semantics.

### C. The Hardware-Assisted Link: `_HARDWARE_PTE`

The `_HARDWARE_PTE` is a processor-defined structure within the `_MMPTE` union. Its primary function is to enable the MMU to translate a virtual address to a physical address. When a `_MMPTE` is in a hardware state, its format aligns with the CPU's requirements for address translation.

`_HARDWARE_PTE`s are located in page tables, which are multi-level data structures residing in physical memory and managed by the kernel. The address of a PTE for a given linear address p can be computed as `&MmPteBase`.

The `_HARDWARE_PTE` structure is architecture-dependent. On x64 systems, it is an 8-byte structure composed of a series of bitfields.

```c
// For x64 systems
typedef struct _HARDWARE_PTE {
  ULONGLONG Valid : 1;        // P bit: Must be 1 for the processor to use the PTE for translation.  
  ULONGLONG Write : 1;        // R/W bit: Controls read/write permissions.  
  ULONGLONG Owner : 1;        // U/S bit: Distinguishes between User (1) and Supervisor (0) access.  
  ULONGLONG WriteThrough : 1; // PWT bit.  
  ULONGLONG CacheDisable : 1; // PCD bit.  
  ULONGLONG Accessed : 1;     // A bit: Set by hardware upon page access.  
  ULONGLONG Dirty : 1;        // D bit: Set by hardware upon a write operation.  
  ULONGLONG LargePage : 1;    // PS bit: Indicates a 2MB/1GB page.  
  ULONGLONG Global : 1;       // G bit.  
  ULONGLONG CopyOnWrite : 1;  // Windows-specific flag for copy-on-write behavior.  
  ULONGLONG Prototype : 1;    // Windows-specific flag for shared memory sections.  
  ULONGLONG reserved0 : 1;
  ULONGLONG PageFrameNumber : 36; // The PFN index, linking to a physical page.  
  ULONGLONG reserved1 : 15;
  ULONGLONG NoExecute : 1;    // The NX/XD bit, preventing code execution from the page.  
} HARDWARE_PTE, *PHARDWARE_PTE;
```

The `Valid` bit is a control flag; if clear, it signals a page fault to the OS. The `PageFrameNumber` field directly contains the index into the `_MMPFN` database, providing the link to the physical memory page. The `NoExecute` bit, also known as the NX/XD bit, is a security feature that prevents code execution from the memory page, mitigating buffer overflow attacks.

---

In a VBS-enabled environment, VTL isolation is enforced by the Hyper-V hypervisor using **Second Level Address Translation (SLAT)** via **Extended Page Tables (EPTs)**. This introduces a two-stage translation: the VTL0 kernel's page tables translate a guest virtual address to a guest physical address, and the hypervisor's EPTs perform a second translation from the guest physical address to the host's physical address. The permissions in the EPTs are authoritative and override any permissions in the VTL0 `_HARDWARE_PTE`s, providing a robust, hardware-enforced security boundary. A VTL0 kernel with full privileges cannot access a VTL1-protected page because the hypervisor's EPT will prevent it, resulting in a hardware exception.

## II. Structures for Higher-Level Memory Management

### A. Managing the Virtual Address Space: `_MMVAD`

The `_MMVAD` (Memory Manager Virtual Address Descriptor) is a fundamental structure for managing a process's virtual address space, representing a contiguous range of allocated or reserved memory. For each process, the memory manager maintains an **AVL tree** of these `_MMVAD` nodes, rooted at the `VadRoot` field in the `EPROCESS` structure. This tree enables efficient tracking of a process's memory regions.

---

The `_MMVAD` structure is a process-specific data structure that resides in the kernel's address space within the `EPROCESS` object. The structure has evolved, but its purpose remains the same.

```c
// _MMVAD structure (x64, Windows 11)  
// Note: This is an aggregation of fields from different versions and VAD types.
typedef struct _MMVAD {
  struct _MMVAD_SHORT Core; // Contains the balanced tree node and address range.
  struct _MMVAD_FLAGS2 VadFlags2; // Bitfields for extended VAD flags.
  struct _SUBSECTION* Subsection; // Pointer to the subsection for file-backed mappings.  
  struct _MMPTE* FirstPrototypePte; // Pointer to the first prototype PTE.  
  struct _MMPTE* LastContiguousPte; // Pointer to the last contiguous PTE.  
  struct _LIST_ENTRY ViewLinks; // Links for views of the same section.  
  struct _EPROCESS* VadsProcess; // A back-pointer to the owning process.  
  union {
    struct _MI_VAD_SEQUENTIAL_INFO SequentialVa;
    struct _MMEXTEND_INFO* ExtendedInfo;
  } u4;
  struct _FILE_OBJECT* FileObject; // A pointer to the file object for the mapping.  
} MMVAD, *PMMVAD;
// _MMVAD_SHORT structure (x64, Windows 11)  
typedef struct _MMVAD_SHORT {
  union {
    struct _MMVAD_SHORT* NextVad;
    struct _RTL_BALANCED_NODE VadNode; // The node in the AVL tree.
  } u1;
  ULONG StartingVpn; // Start Virtual Page Number.  
  ULONG EndingVpn; // End Virtual Page Number.  
  UCHAR StartingVpnHigh;
  UCHAR EndingVpnHigh;
  UCHAR CommitChargeHigh;
  UCHAR SpareNT64VadUChar;
  LONG ReferenceCount; // Number of references to this VAD.
  EX_PUSH_LOCK PushLock; // Lock to control access to the VAD structure.
  union {
    ULONG LongFlags;
    struct _MMVAD_FLAGS VadFlags; // Bitfield for basic VAD flags.
    //... other flag structures
  } u;
  union {
    ULONG LongFlags1;
    struct _MMVAD_FLAGS1 VadFlags1;
  } u1;
  struct _MI_VAD_EVENT_BLOCK* EventList;
} MMVAD_SHORT, *PMMVAD_SHORT;
```
When a process requests memory, a `_MMVAD` entry is created. A call to a function like `VirtualAlloc` with the `MEM_RESERVE` flag creates a VAD node for the specified address range but does not allocate any physical memory or page table entries. The kernel's page fault handler is responsible for allocating physical pages and populating the page tables. When a page in a reserved range is first accessed, a page fault occurs. The kernel's handler finds the VAD for the faulting address and, if the access is valid, allocates a physical page frame, creates a `_HARDWARE_PTE`, and maps the page. This process of on-demand paging continues as the reserved memory is accessed.

### B. File and Image Backing: `_SECTION` and `_SEGMENT`

In the Windows kernel, a `_SECTION` object represents a shared memory region or a memory-mapped file. It provides an abstraction layer for managing file contents in memory independently of any process's view of that file.

`_SECTION` objects are managed by the object manager in VTL0 kernel memory. The `_SEGMENT` structure is a lower-level construct linked to a `_SECTION` object. It holds the array of Prototype PTEs that represent the file's contents, and it is allocated from paged pool in VTL0 kernel memory.

---

The relationship between these structures is as follows: a `_SECTION` object points to a `_CONTROL_AREA` structure. The `_CONTROL_AREA` manages the state of the section and contains a pointer to the `_SEGMENT` structure. The `_SEGMENT` holds the Prototype PTE array, which contains the template PTEs for the file's pages. A `_SECTION` can have multiple parts for different purposes. A single file can have up to two `_CONTROL_AREA` structures, one for data access and one for executable access, enabling different memory protection attributes for each.
```c
// Conceptual _SECTION structure (from Windows 10/11 public symbols)  
typedef struct _SECTION {
  struct _RTL_BALANCED_NODE SectionNode;
  ULONGLONG StartingVpn; // Starting virtual page number of the mapping.
  ULONGLONG EndingVpn;   // Ending virtual page number of the mapping.
  union {
    struct _CONTROL_AREA* ControlArea; // Pointer to the control area for the section.
    struct _FILE_OBJECT* FileObject;   // Pointer to the file object for remote files.
  } u1;
  ULONGLONG SizeOfSection; // The size of the section in bytes.
  //... other members
} SECTION, *PSECTION;
// Conceptual _CONTROL_AREA structure (x64, Windows 11)  
typedef struct _CONTROL_AREA {
  struct _SEGMENT* Segment; // Pointer to the corresponding segment.
  union {
    LIST_ENTRY ListHead;
    VOID* AweContext;
  } u1;
  ULONGLONG NumberOfSectionReferences; // Reference count for section objects.
  ULONGLONG NumberOfPfnReferences; // Reference count for physical pages.
  ULONGLONG NumberOfMappedViews; // Count of views mapped from this control area.
  ULONGLONG NumberOfUserReferences;
  union {
    ULONG Flags;
    struct _MMSECTION_FLAGS SectionFlags;
  } u2;
  EX_FAST_REF FilePointer; // Fast reference to the file object.
  //... other members
} CONTROL_AREA, *PCONTROL_AREA;
// Conceptual _SEGMENT structure (based on function)  
typedef struct _SEGMENT {
  PCONTROL_AREA ControlArea; // Back-pointer to the Control Area.
  ULONG TotalNumberOfPtes; // Total number of PTEs in the prototype PTE array.
  union {
    ULONG SegmentFlags;
    struct _SEGMENT_FLAGS Flags;
  } u;
  ULONGLONG NumberOfCommittedPages;
  ULONGLONG SizeOfSegment;
  //... other members
  struct _MMPTE* PrototypePte; // Pointer to the array of Prototype PTEs.
} SEGMENT, *PSEGMENT;
```
When a process maps a section view (e.g., loading a DLL), the corresponding `_MMVAD` node points to the shared Prototype PTEs in the `_SEGMENT` structure. These Prototype PTEs serve as templates to populate the process's private page tables on demand. This architecture ensures memory efficiency by creating the `_SEGMENT` for a file only once, with all processes sharing the same Prototype PTE array, reducing memory overhead for shared binaries.

### C. I/O and Direct Access: `_MDL`

An `_MDL` (Memory Descriptor List) is a kernel-mode structure that describes the physical memory pages backing a contiguous virtual memory buffer. It is primarily used for I/O operations, particularly **Direct Memory Access (DMA)**, by allowing a driver to access a user-mode buffer without the performance cost of copying it into kernel memory.

---

An `_MDL` structure is a variable-sized object allocated from non-paged pool in the VTL0 kernel's address space. The structure contains a variable-length array of PFNs (Page Frame Numbers) at its end, one for each physical page in the buffer.

```c
// _MDL structure (from public documentation)  
typedef struct _MDL {
  struct _MDL* Next;             // Pointer to the next MDL in a chain.
  CSHORT Size;                   // The size of the MDL structure in bytes.
  CSHORT MdlFlags;               // Flags describing the MDL's state.
  struct _EPROCESS* Process;     // Opaque pointer to the owning process.
  PVOID MappedSystemVa;          // A mapped virtual address in system space.
  PVOID StartVa;                 // The starting virtual address of the buffer.
  ULONG ByteCount;               // The size of the buffer in bytes.
  ULONG ByteOffset;              // The offset into the first physical page.
  ULONG Pages;                // Variable-length array of PFNs.  
} MDL, *PMDL;
```
A driver uses the `IoAllocateMdl` function to create the `_MDL` structure. It then calls `MmProbeAndLockPages` to validate the user-mode buffer's virtual address, populate the `_MDL`'s PFN array with physical page numbers, and lock these pages into RAM, preventing them from being paged out. The `_MDL` can then be provided to a device for a DMA transfer. Incorrect use of `_MDL`s, such as improper handling of access modes in `MmProbeAndLockPages`, can lead to vulnerabilities that bypass the user/kernel memory barrier.

## III. Kernel-Level Resource and Workflow Management

### A. The Handle System: `_HANDLE` and `_HANDLE_TABLE`

A `_HANDLE` is an opaque identifier used by a process to access a kernel object, abstracting the underlying kernel memory address. A handle is not a direct pointer, but an index into a process-specific `_HANDLE_TABLE` that maps the handle value to the kernel object's address and permissions.
The `_HANDLE_TABLE` is a per-process structure. Its address is stored in the `ObjectTable` field of the `EPROCESS` block, located in the VTL0 kernel's address space. The handle table itself is typically allocated from non-paged pool.

```c
// _HANDLE_TABLE_ENTRY structure (x64)
// Note: This is a simplified representation of a complex union-based structure.
typedef struct _HANDLE_TABLE_ENTRY {
  union {
    PVOID Object; // Pointer to the kernel object.
    ULONG_PTR Value; // Alternative representation for debugging or free entries.
  };
  union {
    ACCESS_MASK GrantedAccess; // Access rights for this handle.
    LONG NextFreeTableEntry;
  };
  //... other members
} HANDLE_TABLE_ENTRY, *PHANDLE_TABLE_ENTRY;
// _HANDLE_TABLE structure (x64, Windows 11)
typedef struct _HANDLE_TABLE {
  ULONG NextHandleNeedingPool; // Index for the next available handle.
  LONG ExtraInfoPages;
  volatile ULONGLONG TableCode; // Provides a reference to the handle table entries.
  struct _EPROCESS* QuotaProcess;
  struct _LIST_ENTRY HandleTableList; // List of handle table pages.
  ULONG UniqueProcessId; // The ID of the owning process.
  union {
    ULONG Flags;
    struct {
      UCHAR StrictFIFO:1;
    } FlagsBits;
  } u;
  //... other members
} HANDLE_TABLE, *PHANDLE_TABLE;
```
When a process creates a kernel object, the object manager allocates an entry in the `_HANDLE_TABLE`. This entry, a `_HANDLE_TABLE_ENTRY`, contains a pointer to the kernel object and an `ACCESS_MASK` defining the granted permissions. The kernel returns the handle value to the process. Subsequent use of the handle in a system call causes the kernel to look up the object's address and validate the operation against the `ACCESS_MASK` to enforce access control.

### B. Asynchronous Tasking: Work Items

In the Windows kernel, work items are tasks deferred for later execution to maintain system responsiveness. This is essential for offloading work from high-priority contexts like Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs). A common form of a work item is a Deferred Procedure Call (`DPC`), which allows a high-IRQL routine to schedule lower-priority work to run later at `DISPATCH_LEVEL` IRQL.
A DPC is represented by a `_KDPC` object, which contains a callback function pointer, context data, and a `LIST_ENTRY` for a per-processor queue.
```c
// Conceptual _KDPC structure
typedef struct _KDPC {
  UCHAR Type;
  UCHAR Importance;
  WORD Number;
  LIST_ENTRY DpcListEntry; // Links the DPC object into a per-processor queue.
  PKDEFERRED_ROUTINE DeferredRoutine; // The callback function to be executed.
  PVOID DeferredContext; // Context parameter for the callback.
  PVOID SystemArgument1;
  PVOID SystemArgument2;
  PVOID DpcData;
} KDPC, *PKDPC;
```
An ISR calls `KeInsertQueueDpc` to queue a `_KDPC` object. When the processor returns to `DISPATCH_LEVEL`, a DPC dispatcher executes the pending DPCs. This model ensures that time-critical interrupts are handled with minimal latency while other work is performed asynchronously.

### C. Kernel Memory Management: Partition

The concept of a Partition in the Windows kernel, distinct from a disk partition, is a feature introduced in Windows 10 that allows the kernel to manage collections of physical pages independently. A memory partition is abstracted as a partition object, which is accessed via a handle. User-mode software can interact with these partitions through native APIs like `NtCreatePartition`, `NtManagePartition`, and `NtOpenPartition` from NTDLL.

---

This memory partitioning is a prerequisite for Virtualization-based Security (VBS) and VTLs. The Hyper-V hypervisor uses this concept to divide physical memory into isolated partitions for VTL0 and VTL1, creating a macro-level memory segmentation that is essential for VBS security boundaries.

## IV. The VTL Paradigm: Isolation and Secure Memory

### A. The VTL0 and VTL1 Environment

Virtualization-based security (VBS) leverages the Hyper-V hypervisor to create **Virtual Trust Levels (VTLs)**. VTL0 is the normal, less privileged environment where the standard Windows kernel (`ntoskrnl.exe`) and user-mode applications operate. VTL1 is the secure, more privileged environment where a small Secure Kernel (`securekernel.exe`) and Isolated User Mode (IUM) processes (Trustlets) execute.

---

Isolation between VTL0 and VTL1 is a hardware-enforced mechanism implemented by the Hyper-V hypervisor using **Second Level Address Translation (SLAT)**. The hypervisor allocates separate, exclusive memory blocks for each VTL. VTL0 has no access to VTL1's memory, even at the highest privilege level, while VTL1 has full access to VTL0's resources. This hierarchical design ensures that a VTL0 kernel compromise does not grant access to the VTL1 environment.

Communication between VTL0 and VTL1 occurs via a controlled process using a `VMCALL` instruction, known as a **hypercall**. This instruction causes a VM exit, transferring control to the hypervisor, which then brokers the transition to the Secure Kernel in VTL1. This hardware-mediated communication is critical for securing the VTL1 environment.

### B. Secure Code and Data: `_SECURE_SECTION` and `_SECURE_IMAGE`

A `_SECURE_IMAGE` is a trusted binary permitted to run in the isolated VTL1 environment, such as `securekernel.exe` or a Trustlet like `LSAISO.exe`. These images are managed by the Secure Kernel and are protected from VTL0.

---

`_SECURE_SECTION` describes a memory region protected by the Secure Kernel. This is a conceptual designation, not a specific structure within VTL0. The Secure Kernel protects these regions by instructing the hypervisor to update VTL0's SLAT page tables, setting permissions that VTL0 cannot override. This mechanism is used to protect sensitive data like password hashes managed by Credential Guard.

### C. Advanced Memory Protection: NAR and Reserved Pages

The kernel utilizes Normal Address Ranges (NAR) and Reserved Pages for memory security and efficiency.
A **Normal Address Range (NAR)** is a construct used by the Secure Kernel to track executable memory regions in VTL0, which are validated for technologies like Kernel Control Flow Guard (KCFG). The Secure Kernel maintains a list of these ranges to ensure code execution in VTL0 is restricted to trusted areas. Regions such as the Shadow Stack are tracked as "static NARs," and their permissions are enforced by the hypervisor. No publicly available C structure for the NAR object itself exists, as it is an internal Secure Kernel construct.

---

**Reserved Pages** are an integral part of memory management in both VTL0 and VTL1. The `VirtualAlloc` function with the `MEM_RESERVE` flag reserves a virtual address range but does not allocate physical memory or page tables. This is an efficient way to manage sparse memory usage. A subsequent `VirtualAlloc` call with the `MEM_COMMIT` flag, or a page fault when a reserved page is accessed, triggers the allocation of physical memory and the creation of page table entries by the kernel's page fault handler.

## V. Modern Security and Integrity Components

### A. In-Memory Patching: Hotpatch and Relocations

Hotpatching is a feature in Windows Server that allows security updates to be applied to a running system's in-memory code without requiring a restart. This is critical for high-availability systems.

---

Relocations are fixups in the Portable Executable (PE) file format used by the dynamic linker to adjust hard-coded memory addresses at load time, which is essential for ASLR.

Hotpatching is a post-load, dynamic process. It uses a special hotpatch PE file with a `HotPatchTableOffset` field in the `IMAGE_LOAD_CONFIG_DIRECTORY` to specify the location of the patch information. The `NtManageHotPatch` syscall is used to create and apply these patches.
```c
// Conceptual IMAGE_HOT_PATCH_INFO structure (fields based on public information)  
typedef struct _IMAGE_HOT_PATCH_INFO {
  ULONG  Version;       // Version of the hotpatch structure.
  ULONG  Size;          // Size of this structure.
  ULONG  SequenceNumber;
  ULONG  BaseImageCount;
  ULONG  BaseImageList; // A variable-sized array of hashes for base images.  
  ULONG  BufferOffset;
  ULONG  ExtraPatchSize;
} IMAGE_HOT_PATCH_INFO, *PIMAGE_HOT_PATCH_INFO;
// Conceptual IMAGE_LOAD_CONFIG_DIRECTORY64 structure  
typedef struct _IMAGE_LOAD_CONFIG_DIRECTORY64 {
  DWORD  Size;
  DWORD  TimeDateStamp;
  WORD   MajorVersion;
  WORD   MinorVersion;
  //... other members
  ULONGLONG DynamicValueRelocTable;
  //... other members
  ULONGLONG HotPatchTableOffset; // RVA of the IMAGE_HOT_PATCH_INFO structure.
  //... other members
} IMAGE_LOAD_CONFIG_DIRECTORY64, *PIMAGE_LOAD_CONFIG_DIRECTORY64;
```
Hotpatching requires VBS to be enabled on the system. The kernel can apply patches globally to all running processes, often limited to Microsoft-signed packages to prevent unauthorized code injection.

### B. Control Flow Integrity: Shadow Stack

Shadow Stack is a hardware-assisted feature of Intel's Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET) designed to protect against **Return-Oriented Programming (ROP)** attacks. A Shadow Stack is a secondary, read-only stack that stores an immutable copy of function return addresses. On a function return, the CPU compares the return address on the normal stack with the one on the Shadow Stack; a mismatch triggers a security exception, terminating the program.

---

In the Windows kernel, the Shadow Stack is a key component of **Kernel Control Flow Guard (KCFG)**. The Secure Kernel (VTL1) initializes and manages the Shadow Stack for the VTL0 kernel, tracking its memory region as a "static Normal Address Range (NAR)". The Secure Kernel enforces read-only permissions on the Shadow Stack's physical pages using SLAT EPTs, making it impossible for even a privileged VTL0 attacker to modify it.

## VI. Conclusion

The Windows kernel is a layered system where intricate, interconnected data structures facilitate memory management and security. The `_MMPFN` database tracks physical memory, while the `_HARDWARE_PTE` enables virtual-to-physical address translation. The `_MMVAD` tree organizes a process's virtual address space, and its relationship with `_SECTION` and `_SEGMENT` structures enables shared memory and efficient file mapping. This design is extended and fortified by VBS, which uses the Hyper-V hypervisor and Second Level Address Translation (SLAT) to create isolated Virtual Trust Levels (VTLs). The Secure Kernel (VTL1) and its conceptual data structures, such as `_SECURE_IMAGE` and `_SECURE_SECTION`, leverage this hardware-enforced isolation to protect sensitive code and data from a potentially compromised VTL0. This is demonstrated by the implementation of the Shadow Stack, where the Secure Kernel uses SLAT to apply unalterable read-only permissions on the stack's physical pages, providing a robust defense against ROP attacks.

# The Relationship Between Sections and Images and the EPROCESS Structure

The **EPROCESS** structure is the Windows kernel's representation of a process, containing all the information needed to manage it. This includes the process's virtual address space, which is where images and sections are mapped. The `_SECTION` and `_SEGMENT` objects are not kept within a process's VAD tree; instead, the VAD tree contains references to these shared objects.

---

## How Sections and Images Relate to an EPROCESS Structure

A process's virtual address space is managed by an **AVL tree** of **`_MMVAD`** (`Memory Manager Virtual Address Descriptor`) structures, which is rooted in the **`VadRoot`** field of the `EPROCESS` structure. Each `_MMVAD` node describes a contiguous region of memory within the process's virtual address space.

When a process loads an image (like an EXE or DLL), the kernel follows these steps to map it into memory:

1.  The kernel's object manager checks if a `_SECTION` object already exists for the file. These `_SECTION` objects are stored in a global, system-wide namespace, not within any single `EPROCESS` structure. They act as a central, shared repository for memory-mapped files.
2.  If a `_SECTION` object is found, the kernel creates a new `_MMVAD` node and inserts it into the process's `VadRoot` tree.
3.  The new `_MMVAD` node's **`Subsection`** and **`FirstPrototypePte`** fields are populated with pointers that link it to the shared `_SECTION` and its underlying **`_SEGMENT`** structure.

This design is what enables efficient memory sharing. The `_SECTION` and `_SEGMENT` objects are kept in the kernel's object manager and a paged pool, accessible to all processes. Each individual `EPROCESS` structure only holds pointers to these shared objects via its `_MMVAD` tree.

## Sections and Images

In the context of the Windows kernel, a **section** is a fundamental object that represents a region of memory, often backed by a file. An **image**, specifically a binary executable like a DLL or an EXE, is a type of file that's loaded into memory as a section. The relationship is that an image is a specific instance of a section that is managed in a particular way by the operating system.

---

### Sections: The Memory Mapping Abstraction

A **`_SECTION`** object provides an abstract way for the kernel to manage a memory-mapped file. When a file, say `ntdll.dll`, is mapped into memory, the kernel creates a single `_SECTION` object for it. This object contains metadata about the file, such as its size and where it's located on disk.

Crucially, the `_SECTION` object is not tied to a single process. It's a shared kernel object that can be referenced by multiple processes. This allows for **memory sharing**; when `ntdll.dll` is used by a dozen different programs, the kernel only needs to keep one copy of its contents in physical memory. Each process then gets its own private view of this shared section.

Underneath the `_SECTION` object lies the **`_SEGMENT`** structure, which holds the **Prototype PTEs**. These are like templates for the page table entries of the file. They contain the basic information about each page in the file, but they don't map to physical memory until a process actually needs to access a page. This is a form of **lazy loading**, which is a key optimization.


### Images: A Specific Type of Section

An **image** in the Windows kernel refers to an executable binary file, such as an `.exe` or `.dll`. When you run a program or load a library, the kernel's loader and memory manager work together to map the image file into a process's virtual address space.

The process of loading an image into memory involves creating a `_SECTION` object for the file, if one doesn't already exist. The kernel then creates a `_MMVAD` (Memory Manager Virtual Address Descriptor) for the new process that points to the `_SECTION` object's Prototype PTEs. This establishes the link between the process's virtual address space and the shared, file-backed memory region.

The image's format, typically a Portable Executable (PE) file, defines how the data should be interpreted and mapped. The PE header contains information about the different sections of the binary (e.g., `.text` for code, `.data` for initialized data, etc.), and the kernel's memory manager uses this information to set the correct permissions (e.g., read-only and executable for the `.text` section, read/write for the `.data` section) for the corresponding memory pages.

## PTEs vs Prototype PTEs and Loading

PTEs and Prototype PTEs are both entries used by the Windows kernel to manage virtual memory, but they serve different roles. A **PTE (Page Table Entry)** is a live, per-process entry used for direct address translation, while a **Prototype PTE** is a reusable template, shared between processes, for pages that are backed by a file.

***

### Page Table Entries (PTEs)

A PTE is the fundamental unit of address translation for the CPU's Memory Management Unit (MMU). It's a hardware-defined structure that points a virtual page to a physical page in RAM.

* **Location**: PTEs are stored in a process's **private page tables**. These tables are located in the VTL0 kernel's address space and are specific to each process. The CPU's CR3 register points to the active process's page tables, ensuring memory isolation.
* **Purpose**: They are used for **real-time address translation**. When a process accesses a virtual address, the CPU traverses the page tables to find the corresponding PTE, which provides the physical memory address and permissions.
* **Usage**: PTEs are created on-demand when a process first accesses a memory page. They contain the `PageFrameNumber` (PFN) of the physical page and flags like `Valid` and `NoExecute`. A PTE is unique to a process's view of a memory page.

***

### Prototype Page Table Entries (Prototype PTEs)

A Prototype PTE is a template for pages that are part of a file-backed section. They are the key to memory sharing and lazy loading.

* **Location**: Prototype PTEs are **not** in a process's private page tables. Instead, they are part of a shared, system-wide **`_SEGMENT`** structure that is managed by the kernel's object manager.
* **Purpose**: They act as a **shared blueprint** for all processes that map the same file. The kernel creates one set of Prototype PTEs for a shared DLL, saving memory by avoiding duplication.
* **Usage**: When a process accesses a file-backed memory page for the first time, a page fault occurs. The kernel's page fault handler uses the Prototype PTE as a template to **create a private PTE** in the process's page tables, which then points to the shared physical page in RAM.

### The Binary Loading Process: PTEs vs. Prototype PTEs

The way a binary is loaded into memory is a clear example of the difference between these entries. The Portable Executable (PE) file format organizes a binary into sections with distinct purposes and permissions.

#### The Binary Loading Workflow: Step by Step

The loading process begins when a program requests to load a binary, typically via a call to `LdrLoadDll` or when a process is created with an executable. The kernel's memory manager orchestrates the following workflow:

1.  **Object Manager Lookup (`NtCreateSection`)**: The kernel's object manager first checks if a `_SECTION` object for the requested file (the binary) already exists. This check is performed by searching a system-wide namespace. The call is typically `NtCreateSection` with the `SEC_IMAGE` flag.
    * **If a `_SECTION` exists**: The kernel understands that the file has already been mapped into memory. It increments the `NumberOfMappedViews` counter in the `_CONTROL_AREA` associated with the section and reuses the existing `_SEGMENT` and its Prototype PTEs. This is the **memory-saving path**.
    * **If a `_SECTION` does not exist**: The kernel must create one from scratch. It allocates a new `_SECTION` object, a `_CONTROL_AREA` structure, and a new `_SEGMENT` object. The `_SEGMENT` is where the Prototype PTEs for the binary's file-backed pages will reside. This is the **initial loading path**.

2.  **Mapping the View (`ZwMapViewOfSection`)**: After ensuring a `_SECTION` object is ready, the kernel maps a view of this section into the process's virtual address space. This is done via the `ZwMapViewOfSection` system call. The kernel allocates a contiguous range of virtual addresses and creates a new `_MMVAD` (`Memory Manager Virtual Address Descriptor`) node to represent this range. This `_MMVAD` is inserted into the process's **VAD tree**.

3.  **On-Demand Paging**: The `ZwMapViewOfSection` call populates the `_MMVAD` with pointers to the shared `_SECTION` and `_SEGMENT`. However, it does **not** yet create the per-process PTEs or load the physical pages from disk. The PTEs for the virtual address range are initially set to a special "transition" or "prototype" state. This is the **lazy-loading step**. When the CPU attempts to access a page for the first time, a **page fault** occurs.
    * The kernel's page fault handler looks up the faulting virtual address in the process's VAD tree to find the `_MMVAD` node.
    * The handler finds that the `_MMVAD` points to a `_SECTION` and its Prototype PTEs in a shared `_SEGMENT`.
    * The kernel uses the Prototype PTE as a template to determine where to get the page data from (the file on disk) and what permissions to set.
    * It then allocates a physical page from the `_MMPFN` database, copies the data from the binary file into that page, and finally creates a new, live `_HARDWARE_PTE` in the process's private page tables. This PTE points directly to the newly loaded physical page.
    * The page fault is resolved, and the CPU can now access the memory.

#### Sections Mapped with Prototype PTEs (Shared and File-Backed)

Most of a binary's content is loaded using Prototype PTEs. These sections are read-only and can be shared among multiple processes, which is a major memory optimization.

* **`.text` Section**: This contains the executable code. It's read-only and is mapped via Prototype PTEs, which are then used to create per-process PTEs marked with `NoExecute` and `Read-Only` permissions. All processes share the same physical pages for the code.
* **`.rdata` Section**: Contains read-only data like constants and string literals. This is also shared via Prototype PTEs to save memory.
* **`.idata` and `.rsrc` Sections**: Contain import and resource data, respectively. They are also read-only and mapped using Prototype PTEs.

#### Sections Mapped with Private PTEs (Process-Specific and Writable)

Sections containing process-specific, writable data cannot be shared. The kernel allocates new physical pages for these and creates private PTEs for each process. The `_SEGMENT` for a binary contains Prototype PTEs for *all* of its file-backed pages, including the `.data` section's initial values.

* **For `.data`**: When a page fault occurs for a `.data` page, the kernel allocates a new, private physical page for the process. It then copies the data from the Prototype PTE's location (which points to the file on disk) into this new page. Finally, it creates a `Read/Write` PTE in the process's private page table, pointing to this new, private physical page. This is essentially a specialized **copy-on-load** mechanism.
* **For `.bss`**: For the `.bss` section, the process is similar. The kernel allocates new, zeroed physical pages and creates private, `Read/Write` PTEs that point to these clean pages. There's no data to copy from a file, so it's a direct allocation.

#### The Stack and Heap

The stack and heap are not part of the binary's PE sections. They are dynamic memory regions that are private to each process. They are managed entirely by private PTEs. When a program requests more memory for its stack or heap, the kernel allocates new physical pages and creates private PTEs to map them.

### Clarification on `_SEGMENT` and the `.data` Section

The `.data` section's template is indeed stored in the `_SEGMENT` object. It's not the data itself that is stored, but rather a **reference to the data's location within the file on disk**. The `_SEGMENT` object, through its **Prototype PTEs**, acts as an index into the binary file.

The `.data` section's initial values are part of the binary file on disk. When the kernel creates a `_SEGMENT` object for that binary, it populates the `_SEGMENT` with a series of **Prototype PTEs**. For the read-only sections like `.text`, the Prototype PTEs contain flags that indicate the pages can be shared. For the `.data` section, the Prototype PTEs are marked with flags indicating that the pages are dirty and private, requiring a copy.

The Prototype PTEs for the `.data` section, like all other Prototype PTEs, contain a reference to the file and an offset within the file where the data resides. When a process first touches a page in its `.data` section, a page fault occurs. The page fault handler uses the Prototype PTE to find the exact location of that data in the file on disk, reads it into a newly allocated physical page, and then creates a private PTE for the process that points to this new page. The Prototype PTE's role is not to hold the data itself, but to serve as a **pointer to the data's source** and to define the rules for how that data should be loaded into a process's memory.

The `_SEGMENT` object and its Prototype PTEs are a metadata layer; they describe the file's layout and the memory manager's rules for handling its contents. They are not a temporary storage for the file's data.

### The Binary Loading Workflow: Step by Step

The loading process begins when a program requests to load a binary, typically via a call to `LdrLoadDll` or when a process is created with an executable. The kernel's memory manager orchestrates the following workflow:

1.  **Object Manager Lookup (`NtCreateSection`)**: The kernel's object manager first checks if a `_SECTION` object for the requested file (the binary) already exists. This check is performed by searching a system-wide namespace. The call is typically `NtCreateSection` with the `SEC_IMAGE` flag.
    * **If a `_SECTION` exists**: The kernel understands that the file has already been mapped into memory. It increments the `NumberOfMappedViews` counter in the `_CONTROL_AREA` associated with the section and reuses the existing `_SEGMENT` and its Prototype PTEs. This is the **memory-saving path**.
    * **If a `_SECTION` does not exist**: The kernel must create one from scratch. It allocates a new `_SECTION` object, a `_CONTROL_AREA` structure, and a new `_SEGMENT` object. The `_SEGMENT` is where the Prototype PTEs for the binary's file-backed pages will reside. This is the **initial loading path**.

2.  **Mapping the View (`ZwMapViewOfSection`)**: After ensuring a `_SECTION` object is ready, the kernel maps a view of this section into the process's virtual address space. This is done via the `ZwMapViewOfSection` system call. The kernel allocates a contiguous range of virtual addresses and creates a new `_MMVAD` (`Memory Manager Virtual Address Descriptor`) node to represent this range. This `_MMVAD` is inserted into the process's **VAD tree**.

3.  **On-Demand Paging**: The `ZwMapViewOfSection` call populates the `_MMVAD` with pointers to the shared `_SECTION` and `_SEGMENT`. However, it does **not** yet create the per-process PTEs or load the physical pages from disk. The PTEs for the virtual address range are initially set to a special "transition" or "prototype" state. This is the **lazy-loading step**. When the CPU attempts to access a page for the first time, a **page fault** occurs.
    * The kernel's page fault handler looks up the faulting virtual address in the process's VAD tree to find the `_MMVAD` node.
    * The handler finds that the `_MMVAD` points to a `_SECTION` and its Prototype PTEs in a shared `_SEGMENT`.
    * The kernel uses the Prototype PTE as a template to determine where to get the page data from (the file on disk) and what permissions to set.
    * It then allocates a physical page from the `_MMPFN` database, copies the data from the binary file into that page, and finally creates a new, live `_HARDWARE_PTE` in the process's private page tables. This PTE points directly to the newly loaded physical page.
    * The page fault is resolved, and the CPU can now access the memory.

### Sections Mapped with Prototype PTEs (Shared and File-Backed)

Most of a binary's content is loaded using Prototype PTEs. These sections are read-only and can be shared among multiple processes, which is a major memory optimization.

* **`.text` Section**: This contains the executable code. It's read-only and is mapped via Prototype PTEs, which are then used to create per-process PTEs marked with `NoExecute` and `Read-Only` permissions. All processes share the same physical pages for the code.
* **`.rdata` Section**: Contains read-only data like constants and string literals. This is also shared via Prototype PTEs to save memory.
* **`.idata` and `.rsrc` Sections**: Contain import and resource data, respectively. They are also read-only and mapped using Prototype PTEs.

### Sections Mapped with Private PTEs (Process-Specific and Writable)

Sections containing process-specific, writable data cannot be shared. The kernel allocates new physical pages for these and creates private PTEs for each process. The `_SEGMENT` for a binary contains Prototype PTEs for *all* of its file-backed pages, including the `.data` section's initial values.

* **For `.data`**: When a page fault occurs for a `.data` page, the kernel uses the Prototype PTE to find the data's location in the file on disk. It then allocates a new, private physical page for the process, reads the data from the disk into this new page, and creates a `Read/Write` PTE in the process's private page table that points to it. This is a specialized **copy-on-load** mechanism.
* **For `.bss`**: The `.bss` section is for uninitialized data, so there is no data to load from the file. Instead, the kernel allocates new, zeroed physical pages and creates private, `Read/Write` PTEs that point to them.

### The Stack and Heap

The stack and heap are not part of the binary's PE sections. They are dynamic memory regions that are private to each process. They are managed entirely by private PTEs. When a program requests more memory for its stack or heap, the kernel allocates new physical pages and creates private PTEs to map them.

## The Shared Memory Mechanism

The relationship between sections and images is a perfect example of a shared memory mechanism. The `_SECTION` and `_SEGMENT` structures are the foundational, file-backed shared objects. An image is simply the data that resides within these structures.

When two processes, say `explorer.exe` and `cmd.exe`, both load `kernel32.dll`, the workflow looks like this:

1.  **Process A (`explorer.exe`) loads `kernel32.dll`.** The kernel checks if a `_SECTION` object for `kernel32.dll` already exists. It doesn't, so it creates one. It then creates a `_MMVAD` in `explorer.exe`'s address space that points to this new `_SECTION`.
2.  **Process B (`cmd.exe`) loads `kernel32.dll`.** The kernel checks for the `_SECTION` object again and finds the existing one. It creates a new `_MMVAD` in `cmd.exe`'s address space, but this VAD also points to the *same* `_SECTION` object.
3.  **Physical Memory**. The physical pages of `kernel32.dll` are only loaded once from disk and are referenced by both processes through their respective `_MMVAD`s and the shared `_SECTION`. This saves a significant amount of memory.

In short, a section is the kernel's internal representation of a memory-mapped region. An image is a user-level concept for a binary executable, and the kernel uses sections to efficiently load and manage these images in memory, particularly when multiple processes need to access the same binary.

### Key Structures and Their Locations

* **`_EPROCESS`**: This is the top-level structure for a process. It contains the **`VadRoot`** pointer, which is the entry point to the `_MMVAD` tree for that process. The `_EPROCESS` structure is allocated from the VTL0 kernel's address space.

```c
// Conceptual _EPROCESS structure (simplified)
typedef struct _EPROCESS {
    // ... other members
    LIST_ENTRY ActiveProcessLinks;
    HANDLE_TABLE* ObjectTable; // The handle table for the process.
    VOID* VadRoot; // Pointer to the root of the _MMVAD tree.
    // ... other members
} EPROCESS, *PEPROCESS;
```

* **`_MMVAD`**: This structure is part of the `_MMVAD` tree. It contains the virtual address range for a memory region and crucially, a pointer to its backing object. For image files, this pointer links to a **`_SUBSECTION`** which in turn points to a **`_SECTION`**. The `_MMVAD` structures are dynamically allocated for each process and are tied to a specific `_EPROCESS` object.

```c
// Conceptual _MMVAD structure (simplified for clarity)
typedef struct _MMVAD {
    RTL_BALANCED_NODE VadNode; // Node in the AVL tree.
    ULONG StartingVpn; // Start Virtual Page Number.
    ULONG EndingVpn; // End Virtual Page Number.
    // ... other members
    struct _SUBSECTION* Subsection; // Pointer to the subsection for file-backed mappings.
    struct _MMPTE* FirstPrototypePte; // Pointer to the first prototype PTE.
    // ... other members
} MMVAD, *PMMVAD;
```

* **`_SECTION`**: This is the shared, file-backed object. It is a kernel object managed by the object manager and exists independently of any single process's address space. It contains a pointer to its corresponding **`_SEGMENT`** object, which holds the Prototype PTEs.

```c
// Conceptual _SECTION structure (simplified)
typedef struct _SECTION {
    // ... other members
    struct _CONTROL_AREA* ControlArea; // Points to the control area, which contains the segment.
    // ... other members
} SECTION, *PSECTION;
```

* **`_SEGMENT`**: This structure holds the array of **Prototype PTEs**, which are the actual templates for the file's pages. The `_SEGMENT` and its PTEs are allocated from kernel memory and are the core component that enables multiple processes to share the same physical pages for a loaded image.

```c
// Conceptual _SEGMENT structure (simplified)
typedef struct _SEGMENT {
    // ... other members
    struct _MMPTE* PrototypePte; // Pointer to the array of prototype PTEs.
    // ... other members
} SEGMENT, *PSEGMENT;
```

This layered architecture ensures that memory is used efficiently. The shared `_SECTION` and `_SEGMENT` objects exist only once, regardless of how many processes are using the image. The per-process `_MMVAD` structures simply point to these central objects, providing a lightweight way for each process to gain a view into the shared memory without needing to duplicate the image's pages.
